## General info
This project is for a "company" Alison Cosmetics using HTML. 

* An informational background page is first presented that gives details 
on the company. The anchor element helps user enter their name for a
personalized experience. The name is then stored in a cookie file set to 
expire in 7 days and the second div statement is updated to include their 
name and appropriate welcome message. 


*5 seconds after the body loads, the system generates a random 
number, multiplies the random number by 10 and rounds to the nearest whole number. 
If the rounded number is a multiple of 5, an alert message is presented that the
user has been selected for a survey. When the user clicks the OK button, a survey
page is presented.
